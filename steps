git status

mkdir gitnew (should probably be the repository name, not literally "gitnew")

echo "# git-course" >> README.md

git init

git add README.md

git commit -m "m" (This should be a meaningful commit message instead of just "m")

git branch -m main

git remote add origin path (This should be the actual repository URL) (Only once)

ssh-keygen -o (This command is incomplete and likely incorrect. See below for a better alternative)

ls (This is probably intended to check the contents of the .ssh directory. There is also an instruction to make a directory named "ssh" but it has been crossed out, with the corrected command in the following line)

mkdir .ssh (Should be 'mkdir .ssh')

cd .ssh (Optional)

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Follow 15.

git remote add origin path (This should be the actual repository URL)

git push -u origin main

Important Notes and Corrections:

ssh-keygen Commands: The original ssh-keygen -o command is incorrect. The image then has ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096. This is the correct way to generate an SSH key: Run this command and follow the prompts. It will create a public key (id_rsa.pub) and a private key (id_rsa) in the .ssh directory.

Step 15: Follow 15: Steps 15 onwards describe how to connect to BSH, however, this has already been provided previously.

How to connect to BSH

Settings -> Navigate SSH Keys

Create SSH key

In Terminal
=> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (enter)
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -> click on link, copy to SSH link

Paste on the SSH Key -> Add Key
-> Write access

new powershell

git add, commit, etc.
